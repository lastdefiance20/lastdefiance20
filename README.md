I'm an undergraduate student at Soongsil University and works at MAUM.AI as a senior AI research scientist with a broad interest in artificial intelligence. My current research focuses on several key areas:
- Multimodal models capable of handling diverse inputs and outputs (including video, image, text, audio, and action)
- Fact-checking using large language and vision-language models
- Adapting instruction-following capabilities of English-based large language models to Korean and other languages
